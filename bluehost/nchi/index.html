							This is a closed event on private land and is offered to a limited group which consists of the paid members of the invited clubs and their guests.  The event takes place on the property of one our club members whose spacious yard/barn/woods is located outside of Salisbury.  Overnight tent camping is encouraged, however trailer parking space is very limited.  Make arrangements asap if you want to bring a camper.  Our camper space is the same place as our parking spaces.  
							Last year there were over 50 kegs and 150 people from area homebrew clubs enjoying homebrew, food, educational demonstrations, music, and fellowship.  Every effort is made to comply with all ALE laws and provide a safe and relaxing environment for your enjoyment.
							If coming from I-85 it's a good idea to take Exit 71 - Peeler road.  When you are on Edgewood Court look for a small dirt road which plunges off into the woods 
							Please drive slowly when entering or exiting the event area so you don't run over people/dogs/equipment/llamas.  Pay attention to the signs as there is a new driveway this year.  When you arrive stop at the check in tent for final details.

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">
							Due to our expanding participation we have some changes this year.  Please read the following:
							Each club can bring no more than 10 kegs and occupy no more than one 10x10 space.  Each club is expected to bring everything they need to serve their beer (tables, taps, tubs, ice, tent, signs, tools, etc).  Please bring enough ice to chill your kegs and jockey boxes.  We will have some ice on hand to refill your jockey boxes should your ice melt or your kegs need extra cooling.  Just let us know.  
							Homebrew bottles/growlers are also welcome.  Beer is self serve so no need for anyone to be stuck behind a jockey box.  It’s a good idea to bring labels or something to identify your beers.  Some people bring a copy of the recipe or details of their beer and put it by their tap so other brewers know about your beer.  
							We suggest that you should bring an extension cord and a string of LED or christmas lights to illuminate your serving area once it gets dark.

							Try to put a number on how many people and kegs your club will be coming with by October 1.  We need those numbers as soon as possible to plan for the day.  Even if you aren’t sure exactly, an approximation gives us something to work with.  
							Putting on this event costs CABREW a non trivial amount of money.  We ask each club to donate a few dollars (about $40) to help cover the cost of porta johns, paper goods, ice, etc.  We do not do this to make money we just want to cover the costs.
							Do a demo.  We are all about education, If you want to do a demonstration on anything beer related let us know and we can work out the details.  
							Collect and bring swag to add to the pile for the door prizes.  
							We are all home brewers attending to having a good time.  During the day if you see something that needs done (empty a full trash can, help carry something, moving a picnic table, making signs, etc) jump in and help out.  It’s what makes the day fun for everyone.
